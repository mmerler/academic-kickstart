# Biography

I am Research Staff Member in the Vision and Multimedia Group at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center in New York. My interests are in Multimedia and Computer Vision, with a focus on sports video analysis and facial attributes estimation. Before joining IBM in 2012 I did my PhD in Computer Science at Columbia University with Professor John Kender, and before that I studied Telecommunications Engineering in Trento, Italy, where I am from. 
I have publications in several peer-reviewed journal and conferences, including IEEE TMM, CVPR, ACM Multimedia, ICMR, MICCAI, ICME, etc.
Among other professional activities, I have served as Area Chair for ACM Multimedia in 2016 and 2017, and local organization chair and webmaster for ICMR in 2016.  In 2016 I was co-editor of the special issue on Advanced learning for large-scale heterogeneous computing for the journal Neurocomputing. In 2009, I was one of the recipients of the Yahoo! Key Scientific Challenge Award.
