Ciao! I am Research Staff Member in the Vision and Multimedia Group under [IBM Research AI](https://www.research.ibm.com/ai/). I am based in the T. J. Watson Research Lab in New York. My interests are in Multimedia and Computer Vision, with a focus on sports video analysis and facial attributes estimation.  
I have publications in several peer-reviewed journal and conferences, including IEEE TMM, CVPR, ACM Multimedia, ICMR, MICCAI, etc.
Among other professional activities, I have served as Area Chair for ACM Multimedia in 2016 and 2017, and local organization chair and webmaster for [ICMR in 2016](https://http://www.icmr2016.com).  In 2016 I was co-editor of the special issue on Advanced learning for large-scale heterogeneous computing for the journal Neurocomputing. You can look at my CV here.
