abstract = "The production of sports highlight packages summarizing
a gameâ€™s most exciting moments is an essential task for
broadcast media. Yet, it requires labor-intensive video editing.
We propose a novel approach for auto-curating sports
highlights, and use it to create a real-world system for the
editorial aid of golf highlight reels. Our method fuses information
from the playersâ€™ reactions (action recognition
such as high-fives and fist pumps), spectators (crowd cheering),
and commentator (tone of the voice and word analysis)
to determine the most interesting moments of a game.
We accurately identify the start and end frames of key shot
highlights with additional metadata, such as the playerâ€™s
name and the hole number, allowing personalized content
summarization and retrieval. In addition, we introduce new
techniques for learning our classifiers with reduced manual
training data annotation by exploiting the correlation
of different modalities. Our work has been demonstrated at
a major golf tournament, successfully extracting highlights
from live video streams over four consecutive days."
